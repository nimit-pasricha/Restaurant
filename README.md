# Restaurant

A webpage which displays information about a cake shop made using HTML, CSS and JS.

The page is scarcely styled because it was made primarily for practicing ES6 Modules and Webpack. The image and centered-heading on the home tab look very ugly, and are present only so I could practice asset-management with Webpack.

ES6 Module is incredible. Organizing my code using classes was just not fun. IIFEs were very interesting and I probably would've gotten comfortable with them in a few more projects, but ES6 Modules are more intuitive and easier to navigate, so I'd like to use them as much as possible, especially for larger applications.
